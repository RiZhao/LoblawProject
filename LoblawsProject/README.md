#  Loblaw's Project

## Author - Bill Zhao

## Build Tools

Built with Xcode Version 12.4, for iPhones, iOS 13.0

No external dependencies used

## Description

* LPCartListTableViewController contains a tableview that displays the data that is downloaded
* LPCartItemDetailViewController contains the details of the selected item
* Data is downloaded with LPApiRequest
* Images are downloaded and stored to file system so extra downloads will not be necessary 
* Filter button can be used to filter the data by the item type
* Wrote a unit test for the model as it is the easiest way to test if a model is modelled correctly

## Final Thoughts

I appreciate this opportunity and would love to hear any feedback!
I spent about 6 hours on this project.
